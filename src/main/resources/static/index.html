        <h2>Time limit</h2>
        <p>
            The time limit is 2 hours.<br>
            Please do not take into account the time you need for the setup (see below).
        </p><h2>Setup</h2>
        <p>
            Start with cloning the repository containing the service mock project found <a
                href="https://bitbucket.org/afklmdevnet/simple-travel-api-mock" target="_blank">here</a>.
            All the details required to start the service mock project and how to use it can be found in the included readme.
            The service mock project should NOT be altered and should only be used from your project.
            You can use the current project as starting point/template for your project.
        </p>
        <p>
            The service mock project provides a couple of resources needed to complete the tasks, try them first
            in a client (i.e. <a href="https://www.getpostman.com/" target="_blank">postman</a>) 
            to get familiar with them.
            Please do note that the resources are protected and require application level
            authentication (client-id:travel-api-client, secret:psw),
            grant-type is client_credentials.
        </p>
        <h2>Assignment</h2>
        <h3>Create a user interface</h3>
        <p>
            Create a web user interface where a customer of the site could do the following:
        <ul>
            <li>Be able to select an origin.</li>
            <li>Be able to select a destination.</li>
            <li>Retrieve a fare offer for the given origin-destination combination.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Selections for origin and/or destination should be searchable, in other words the
            customer should be able to find an origin or destination by providing a few characters that would
            match either an airport code, name or description. The user interface may be in any technique
            that you feel comfortable with.
        </p>
        <h3>Create a backend supporting the user interface</h3>
        <p>
            The user interface requires a dedicated backend that supports it, build this in the
            provided template using spring-boot.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Consume the mocked services from the service mock project.</li>
            <li>The authentication is on application level, so make sure the user interface is not
                bothered with authentication.
            </li>
            <li>The mock is a bit inefficient, the fare result only returns origin/destination codes
                without any additional details. When handling this request for your user interface
                retrieve details for origin, destination and the actual fare and return a single
                result to your user interface. Doing this sequentially would not be very efficient 
                so perform these service calls in parallel.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Make the application configurable</h3>
        <p>
            No hard coded values for things like endpoints, etc. Everything should be configurable in
            some kind of configuration file.
        </p>
        <h2>Bonus points!</h2>
        <p>Bonus points can be earned by implementing any or all of the additional tasks below:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The mock service does not provide any form or sorting, find a way to add sorting
                without having to change the original mock
            </li>
            <li>Provide a thread name that looks like 'async-task-{thread_id}' for all threads that perform async tasks.</li>
            <li>Show us your knowledge of java up to and including the latest released version!</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
            By no means is the goal to get a solution covering all special cases in a 100% robust
            way. Requiring this would be naive given the time limit! It's important that you can explain
            why you chose your solution instead of another.
        </p>
        <p>    
            At least the functionality that you deliver should be error free. What you implement and how
            you do it is subject to your creativity and ambition :-). Good luck!
